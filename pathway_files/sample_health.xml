    <risks_limitations><![CDATA[<p><b>Risk of Laboratory Technical Problems or Laboratory Error</b></p>

<p>The certified testing laboratory has standard and effective procedures in place to protect against technical and operational problems. However, such problems may still occur. The testing laboratory receives samples collected by patients and physicians. Problems in shipping to the laboratory or sample handling can occur, including but not limited to damage to the specimen or related paperwork, mislabeling, and loss or delay of receipt of the specimen. Laboratory problems can occur that might lead to inability to obtain results. Examples include, but are not limited to, sample mislabeling, DNA contamination, un-interpretable results, and human and/or testing system errors. In such cases, the testing laboratory may need to request a new sample. However, upon re-testing, results may still not be obtainable.</p>

<p>As with all medical laboratory testing, there is a small chance that the laboratory could report inaccurate information. For example, the laboratory could report that a given genotype is present when in fact it is not. Any kind of laboratory error may lead to incorrect decisions regarding medical treatment and/or diet and fitness recommendations. If a laboratory error has occurred or is suspected, a health care professional may wish to pursue further evaluation and/or other testing. Further testing may be pursued to verify any results for any reason.</p>

<p><b>Limitations</b></p>

<p>The purpose of this test is to provide information about how a tested individual’s genes may affect carrier status for some inherited diseases, responses to some drugs, risk for specific common health conditions, and/or selected diet, nutrition and/or exercise responses, as well as to learn more about the tested individual’s ancient ancestry, depending upon the specific genetic testing that is ordered by the health care professional. Tested individuals should not make any changes to any medical care (including but not limited to changes to dosage or frequency of medications, diet and exercise regimens, or pregnancy planning) based on genetic testing results without consulting a health care professional.</p>

<p>The science behind the significance or interpretation of certain testing results continues to evolve. Although great strides have been made to advance the potential usefulness of genetic testing, there is still much to be discovered. Genetic testing is based upon information, developments and testing techniques that are known today. Future research may reveal changes in the interpretation of previously obtained genetic testing results. For example, any genetic test is limited by the variants being tested. The interpretation of the significance of some variants may change as more research is done about them. Some variants that are associated with disease, drug response, or diet, nutrition and exercise response may not be tested; possibly these variants have not yet been identified in genetic studies.</p>

<p>Many of the conditions and drug responses that are tested are dependent on genetic factors as well as nongenetic factors such as age, personal health and family health history, diet, and ethnicity. As such, an individual may not exhibit the specific drug response, disease, or diet, nutrition and exercise response consistent with the genetic test results.</p>

<p>Another limitation for some conditions, particularly in the areas of diet and exercise, is that genetic associations have been studied and observed in Caucasian populations only. In this case, the interpretations and recommendations are made in the context of Caucasian studies, but the results may or may not be relevant to tested individuals who are of non-Caucasian or mixed ethnicities.</p>

<p>Based on test results and other medical knowledge of the tested individual, health care professionals might consider additional independent testing, or consult another health care professional or genetic counselor.</p>]]></risks_limitations>
